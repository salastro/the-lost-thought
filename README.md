# The Lost Thought

Here shall every writable thought of mine mere lost existence be. Considerable
thoughts are what is the most valuable to any capable intellect. It shall
neither be affected by what lies behind the collective nor the incapabilities of
the individual. Thus, this does not try to be anything other than what it really
is, to achieve — what I believe to be — the only noble goal to reach.
